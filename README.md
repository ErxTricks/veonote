## Description  
Veo Note is a web-based application designed for efficient note-taking and management, built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The application allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter notes based on weekly ranges. All data is stored locally using **localStorage**, enabling users to access their notes without requiring an internet connection.

## Key Features
1. **Easy Note Creation**: Users can easily add new notes via the "Add Note" button, and existing notes are displayed in a structured format.
2. **Weekly Filtering**: Users can filter notes by week. There is an option to select a date range and display all notes within that specific week.
3. **Paginated Navigation**: The app includes pagination, allowing users to move between weeks with "Next" for the following week and "Prev" for the previous week.
4. **Edit & Delete Notes**: Each note comes with options to edit or delete, making note management flexible and user-friendly.
5. **Local Storage (localStorage)**: All note data is stored in **localStorage**, ensuring notes remain accessible even after page reloads.

## Tech
- **React**: Provides a responsive and fast user experience with efficient state management.
- **Vite**: As a lightweight and fast bundler, it speeds up both the development and build processes compared to traditional tools.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Simplifies the styling process with its utility-first CSS framework, ensuring consistent and easily modifiable UI.
- **localStorage**: Local data storage allows the app to be used offline without data loss.
